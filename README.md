REACT DICTIONARY APP:

Application Running Via Netlify Server: https://react-dictionary-app-gsk.netlify.app/

This React JS app uses a Dictionary API to retrieve information regarding the word inputted. 
This information includes several definitions under different contexts, several synonyms, and an audio representation of the word if it is supported. 
Additionally, Material UI was used for React, to create the user interface, and allow for a Dark Mode feature.
